What if you want information about images? This can be done using machine learning. Specifically, classification of images is useful, and we need classification datasets to train models.

MNIST was the first major dataset and consisted of handwritten numbers. Caltech 101 consisted of objects, but there were spurious correlations. ImageNet contains lots of labeled images.
