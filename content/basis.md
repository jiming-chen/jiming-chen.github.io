*Silicon Valley, CA** — In a landmark announcement emphasizing inclusion, communication, and community, has officially declared **American Sign Language (ASL)** as its school’s official language.

The decision, shared this week across campus announcements and advisory meetings, was met with excitement, curiosity, and a wave of students immediately attempting to fingerspell their friends’ names.

## Why ASL?
School leaders explained that ASL represents values deeply aligned with the BASIS mission:
- **Accessibility:** Communication that centers inclusivity and equity  
- **Clarity:** Expression that values intention as much as precision  
- **Community:** A shared language that brings people together—literally face to face  

“ASL reminds us that communication is more than words,” said one faculty member. “It’s about attention, respect, and understanding.”

## A Language You Can See
Students noted that ASL feels especially fitting in a high-energy academic environment. “It’s expressive, it’s visual, and it forces you to actually look at the person you’re talking to,” said a sophomore. “Also, it makes silent collaboration way cooler.”

Clubs and classes are already exploring ways to incorporate ASL more formally, from morning announcements to performances and assemblies.

## Setting a New Standard
By recognizing ASL as its official language, BASIS Independent Silicon Valley joins a growing movement of schools highlighting accessibility and Deaf culture as central—not auxiliary—to education.

Hands may be moving a little more these days on campus, but the message is clear.
