I study Computer Science at Cornell University.

I am currently involved with various startups across AI and healthcare, B2B and B2C. I have gained experience with full stack development, deploying RAG and agents, as well as meeting people in industry to identify pain points and target product market fit.

During the summer of 2024, I researched using LLMs for hardware design under {{< newtabref href="https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/" title="Zhiru Zhang" >}} funded by an Engineering Learning Initiatives grant. See our report {{< newtabref href="/about/Chen_Shao_Report.pdf" title="here" >}}. We also innovated new methods of Verilog dataset creation and submitted our results to the ICCAD Contest on LLM-Assisted Hardware Design, where we placed 9th.

At Cornell, I work on verification of RTL designs for a custom chip as part of {{< newtabref href="https://c2s2.engineering.cornell.edu/" title="Cornell Custom Silicon Systems" >}}. My work consists of formal verification as well as simulation testing, and I have helped verify blocks including an SPI minion, LBIST, and FFT.
