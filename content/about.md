* I study Computer Science at Cornell University.
* Last summer, I researched using LLMs for hardware design under {{< newtabref href="https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/" title="Zhiru Zhang" >}} funded by an Engineering Learning Initiatives grant. See our report {{< newtabref href="/about/Chen_Shao_Report.pdf" title="here" >}}.
* I am working on formal verification of RTL designs on {{< newtabref href="https://c2s2.engineering.cornell.edu/" title="Cornell Custom Silicon Systems" >}}.
* In my free time, I enjoy playing the {{< newtabref href="/piano" title="piano" >}}, which I currently study under {{< newtabref href="https://music.cornell.edu/andrew-zhou" title="Andrew Zhou" >}}, and reading (currently reading *Never Let Me Go* by Kazuo Ishiguro).
* I am interested in philosophy. I am an editor for Logos: The Cornell Undergraduate Philosophy Journal. See the 2024 edition {{< newtabref href="/about/Logos-Journal-Volume-XX-Spring-2024.pdf" title="here" >}}. Or see a paper I wrote on platonism in philosophy of mathematics {{< newtabref href="/about/PHIL3780.pdf" title="here" >}}.
* I write problems for the {{< newtabref href="https://bigredmathcomp.org/" title="Cornell University Big Red Math Competition" >}}.
* Some relevant coursework:
    * Analysis of Algorithms
    * Graduate Probability Theory I
    * Operating Systems
    * Functional Programming in OCaml
