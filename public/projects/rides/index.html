Demo

Motivation
There is a lot of information we can work with:

Each ride has an associated happiness.
Each ride has a wait time.
Total time must not exceed the time the park is open.
Walking between any two rides takes a certain amount of time.
Throughout the day, wait times and walk times (crowd levels) change.

My first thought was to use a maximum flow reduction with Ford-Fulkerson. However, there seemed to be too many factors which made Ford-Fulkerson seem infeasible."><meta name=author content="Jiming Chen"><link rel=canonical href=https://jiming-chen.github.io/projects/rides/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.862d2ab5d22734725b747026f6cbcd72cf56acbcb80e88f95d22ca71d767e619.css integrity="sha256-hi0qtdInNHJbdHAm9svNcs9WrLy4Doj5XSLKcddn5hk=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://jiming-chen.github.io/icons/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://jiming-chen.github.io/icons/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://jiming-chen.github.io/icons/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://jiming-chen.github.io/icons/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://jiming-chen.github.io/%3C/icons/apple-touch-icon.png%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://jiming-chen.github.io/projects/rides/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-MlJdn/WNKDGXveldHDdyRP1R4CTHr3FeuDNfhsLPYrq2t0UBkUdK2jyTnXPEK1NQ crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-VQ8d8WVFw0yHhCk5E8I86oOhv48xLpnDZx5T9GogA/Y84DcCKWXDmSDfn13bzFZY crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.2/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-+XBljXPPiv+OzfbB3cVmLHf4hdUFHlWNZN5spNQ7rmHTXpd7WvJum6fIACpNNfIR crossorigin=anonymous onload=renderMathInElement(document.body)></script><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){renderMathInElement(document.body,{delimiters:[{left:"$$",right:"$$",display:!0},{left:"$",right:"$",display:!1}]})})</script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-KTD621L9T6"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-KTD621L9T6")</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://jiming-chen.github.io/projects/rides/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Jiming Chen"><meta property="og:title" content="Optimal Theme Park Ride Order"><meta property="og:description" content="If we assign happiness to certain rides and have information about how much time it takes to ride a string of rides in a certain order, how can we maximize happiness in one day at a theme park?
