Tools like this are not unique, but they are offered as a service for high fees, so I decided to make a simple version myself.\nRather than search for arbitrage opportunities, it looks for statistical arbitrage-esque market inefficiencies since sports betting “markets” are somewhat inefficient.\nDetails I included support for two devigging methods: multiplicative (scales implied probabilities equally so they sum to 1) and power (does the same thing but with exponents).\nTo determine bet sizing, I used the (logarithmic) wager limit on Pinnacle, which indicates their confidence in their odds for a bet, and Kelly criterion, assuming the devigged implied probabilities were the true probabilities.\nFig. 1. Screenshot of GUI showing positive EV bets. Bets are sorted by risk amount and are highlighted green if they meet certain criteria. Exploration Simply placing all bets is not profitable. Pinnacle is known to be sharper for moneylines, handicaps, and totals, not so much player props. To test this idea, I simply observed results for all bets for about two weeks (backtesting is hard).\nAs expected, hypothetical profit for all bets steadily declined, but limiting bets to moneylines, handicaps, and totals shorter than or equal to -120 was profitable. Of course, you could use hypothesis testing here, but I like vibes. EDIT: It turns out vibes were not enough, but after some digging, it seems that even with this filter, NBA, NHL, and SHL moneylines are not profitable, e.g. Pinnacle is not sharp enough for those markets. However, NCAAB , NCAAF, and NFL moneylines (and a couple more markets) are. See the big table below for details. Underdogs being unprofitable suggests that even though the power method accounts for a larger vigorish on the underdog side, it is not enough.\nFig. 2. Results from 11/17/2024 to 12/5/2024 using a bankroll size of around $1,000 and filtering bets as outlineed above. Since bets have shorter odds, losses on losing bets are generally greater than profits on winning bets. Finally, I added another GUI to periodically monitor for new opportunities and send notifications, but it looks pretty much the same as the first GUI.\nAfter observing about 700 bets, I examined how profit was affected by odds, league, and bet type. I arrived at these results:\nLeague Bet Type Odds Range Profit Wagered ROI NBA Moneyline -10000 to -120 -$54.56 $216.50 -25.20% Handicap -10000 to -120 -$10.50 $16.00 -65.63% Other -10000 to -120 -$18.20 $233.02 -7.81% Moneyline -119 to 10000 -$12.97 $38.40 -33.78% Handicap -119 to 10000 -$36.90 $53.90 -68.46% Total Points -119 to 10000 $0.73 $100.40 0.73% Other -119 to 10000 $2.27 $54.37 4.17% NCAAB Moneyline -10000 to -120 $110.14 $665.50 16.55% Handicap -10000 to -120 -$32.58 $110.50 -29.49% Total Points -10000 to -120 $2.25 $6.00 37.50% Moneyline -119 to 10000 $15.79 $13.00 121.46% Handicap -119 to 10000 -$34.82 $57.50 -60.55% Total Points -119 to 10000 $15.61 $206.20 7.57% NFL Moneyline -10000 to -120 $18.49 $56.90 32.50% Handicap -10000 to -120 -$4.00 $4.00 -100.00% Total Points -10000 to -120 -$1.00 $1.00 -100.00% Moneyline -119 to 10000 -$8.00 $8.00 -100.00% Handicap -119 to 10000 -$5.50 $5.50 -100.00% Total Points -119 to 10000 -$3.42 $16.00 -21.36% Other -119 to 10000 $46.40 $7.60 610.53% NCAAFB Moneyline -10000 to -120 $37.26 $156.28 23.84% Handicap -10000 to -120 $8.30 $19.00 43.66% Moneyline -119 to 10000 -$1.00 $2.00 -50.00% Handicap -119 to 10000 -$1.05 $23.00 -4.55% Total Points -119 to 10000 -$16.00 $56.50 -28.32% NHL Moneyline -10000 to -120 $0.63 $54.00 1.17% Handicap -10000 to -120 -$11.12 $84.00 -13.24% Total Points -10000 to -120 $9.66 $21.00 45.99% Moneyline -119 to 10000 -$2.50 $2.50 -100.00% Total Points -119 to 10000 -$7.52 $9.50 -79.15% Other -119 to 10000 -$5.25 $14.50 -36.21% SHL Moneyline -10000 to -120 -$0.62 $37.50 -1.66% NL Moneyline -10000 to -120 -$6.83 $31.50 -21.68% EPL Moneyline -10000 to -120 $1.29 $6.50 19.92% Other -119 to 10000 $2.70 $1.00 270.00% UCL Moneyline -119 to 10000 $2.20 $1.00 220.00% IWF Moneyline -10000 to -120 $0.50 $11.50 4.35% AO Moneyline -10000 to -120 -$13.11 $35.50 -36.93% Moneyline -119 to 10000 $0.64 $16.00 4.00% Fig. 3.
