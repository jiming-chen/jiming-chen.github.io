If you open task manager, you will see hundreds of processes running all running at the same time. There is the illusion that there is a CPU dedicated to each program, but in reality, all of them have to time share on a single CPU.

A round-robin scheduler continuously runs the process at the front of the queue then moves it to the back.\nThe process control block (PCB) is the unit that contains the context. It should include scheduling state, stack pointer, and a pointer to the next PCB.

This also prevents processes from accessing memory that isn’t theirs. However, this can be difficult to implement.\nScheduling There are several options we have for scheduling. One is first-come first-server (FCFS). It is non-preemptive, meaning each program runs until it voluntarily gives up the CPU. This is easy to implement because we don’t have to force it to switch contexts, but at the same time, if there is a bug or infinite loop, one process can affect the other processes.\nRound-robin (RR) scheduling cuts each process into chunks.
