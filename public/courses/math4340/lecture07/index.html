Recall that rings are sets along with two operations, $+$ and $*$.

Additive group: $(R,+)$ is an abelian group, which we call $R$.
Multiplicative group: $(R^*,*)$ is a group.

The reason we use $R^*$ is because $(R,*)$ doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have inverses, so we define

We say $R$ is called an integral domain if $R$ is commutative (meaning multiplication is commutative) and if $ab = 0$ implies $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.

Multiplicative group: $(R^*,*)$ is a group. The reason we use $R^*$ is because $(R,*)$ doesn’t necessarily have inverses, so we define\n$$R^* = \\{r \\in R \\mid \\exists r^\\prime, rr^\\prime = r^\\prime r = 1\\}.$$\nWe say $R$ is called an integral domain if $R$ is commutative (meaning multiplication is commutative) and if $ab = 0$ implies $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. Thus, if you have any two nonzero elements, their product is nonzero.\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain. However, $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is not because the class of $2$ and the class of $3$ are such that $[2][3] = [6] = [0]$.\nFields We call $R$ a field if\nit is commutative, non-zero elements have (multiplicative) inverses (technically stronger than ring requirement), and $0 \\neq 1$. Subrings We say $S \\subset R$ is a subring if is a ring under the same operations. Importantly, this means $0$ and $1$ are in the subring. Apparently, some “subrings” can have different identities from the large ring, which is why we specify “same operations.”\nExample: $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a subring of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nRing Homomorphisms A ring homomorphism is a map which is compatible with the operations. In other words,\n$$\\phi : R \\to R^\\prime$$\nis such that\n$\\phi(0) = 0$, $\\phi(a + b) = \\phi(a) + \\phi(b)$, $\\phi(1) = 1$, and $\\phi(a*b) = \\phi(a)*\\phi(b)$. Some people drop the third condition, but we prefer to keep it. Additionally, condition $4$ implies condition $1$. Remember that the elements and operations on the right side are different from the left.\nFact: $S$ is a subring of $R$ is equivalent to saying $S \\xhookrightarrow{} R$ is a ring homomorphism, where $\\xhookrightarrow{}$ is the inclusion map.\nFact: If $\\phi : R \\to R^\\prime$ is a homomorphism, then $$\\text{im}(\\phi) = \\{\\phi(r) \\mid r \\in R\\} \\subseteq R^\\prime$$ is a subring or $R^\\prime$, and $$\\text{ker}(\\phi) = {r \\in R \\mid \\phi(r) = 0} \\subseteq R$$ is not a subring or $R$.\nGroup Homomorphisms vs. Ring Homomorphisms If $G$ is any group, and $S$ is the trivial group with $1$ element, then there is only one homomorphism from $G$ to $S$ because every element in $G$ must map to the identity element in $S$.\nAdditionally, there is only one homomorphism from $S$ to $G$ because the identity in $S$ must map to the identity in $G$.\nFor rings, let $S$ be the trivial ring with $1$ element, where $0 = 1$. Then, there is a unique map from $R \\to S$.\nThere is always a unique homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z} \\to R$. We can do this by setting $\\phi(0) = 0_R$ and $\\phi(1) = 1_R$ and setting $\\phi(2) = \\phi(1) + \\phi(1) = 1_R + 1_R$ and so on.\nCharacteristic of Rings Let $\\phi$ be a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z} \\to R$. Then,\n$$\\text{char} R = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026 \\phi \\text{ is injective}, \\phi(n) \\neq 0 \\text{ for } n \\neq 0 \\\\ n \u0026 \\phi(n) = 0, n \\text{ is the smallest such } n. \\end{cases}$$\nFor integral domains, the characteristic is either $0$ or a prime number.\nProducts of Groups vs. Products of Rings If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are groups, then we are forced to make $G_1\\times G_2$ such that\n$$(g,h)*(g^\\prime,h^\\prime) = (gg^\\prime,hh^\\prime).$$\nThis also allows us to make projections like $p_1((g,h)) = g$. Importantly, there are also two maps, $\\iota_1$ and $\\iota_2$ which go in the opposite direction. We are forced to let the other element in the output be the identity of the other group:\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\iota_1(g) \u0026= (g,e_2), \\\\ \\iota_2(h) \u0026= (e_1,h). \\end{aligned}$$\nIn the case of rings, if we let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be rings, $R_1\\times R_2$ is a ring, and $0$ in the ring $R_1\\times R_2$ is $(0,0)$ and the $1$ is $(1,1)$. This time, we have\n$$(g,h) + (g^\\prime,h^\\prime) = (g + g^\\prime,h + h^\\prime) \\text{ and } (g,h)*(g^\\prime,h^\\prime) = (gg^\\prime,hh^\\prime).$$\nThis is pretty expected though one would still have to verify the ring properties.\nAdditionally, we have the same projection mappings. However, $\\iota_1 : R_1 \\to R_1 \\times R_2$ is not a ring homomorphism because while the image of the function is closed uner addition and multiplication, it is not a subring.\n","wordCount":"712","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-02-05T12:23:25-05:00","dateModified":"2025-02-05T12:23:25-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jiming Chen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/courses/math4340/lecture07/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jiming Chen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/icons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/icons/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
